# Netflix SQL Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project performs SQL-based data analysis on the Netflix dataset.  
The task involves extracting, analyzing, and summarizing insights from structured data using SQL queries.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Contents
- Contains all SQL queries for the analysis.
- Folder containing screenshots of the dataset (and outputs if available).
- Original dataset used for reference.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench (for running SQL queries)
- Excel (for viewing the dataset)
- GitHub (for version control)

## ðŸ“Š SQL Concepts Covered
1. `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
2. Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN)
3. Subqueries
4. Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
5. Creating Views
6. Index optimization

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Import the dataset into MySQL (if running queries).
2. Open `sql_queries_t4.sql` in MySQL Workbench.
3. Execute the queries to get results.
4. Refer to the `screenshots/` folder for dataset previews.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- The database is not included as a `.sql` dump in this repo.
- Only the queries and dataset screenshots are provided.
